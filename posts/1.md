I recently took a course on Frontend Masters — *JavaScript: The Hard Parts, v2*. It made me realize something I hadn't thought about in a while: how much of JavaScript I use every day without really understanding how it works.

I've been building web apps professionally for a few years, mostly on the backend. I'm comfortable with JavaScript. Setting up projects, building features, debugging — it all comes naturally now. But maybe that's exactly the problem.

At some point, I stopped being curious.

Early on, I was obsessed with understanding everything — how Node works under the hood, what "this" actually refers to, how promises really behave. I would break things just to see how they worked. Learning was fun.

But somewhere along the way, I started doing only what I needed to. I wasn't asking "why" anymore. I was just writing code that worked and moving on.

This course reminded me how much I've forgotten — not in knowledge, but in mindset.

And that's okay. It's not a problem that I don't know everything. But it *is* a problem if I stop trying to understand more deeply. Because asking questions is how we grow. It's what makes this job fun. And it's what I want to get back to.

So now, I'm trying to rebuild that habit — to pause every now and then and ask: "Do I actually understand this, or am I just doing it out of muscle memory?"

That simple shift makes all the difference.
